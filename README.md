# creed_gpt

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

By Cloning the master branch, you will have full access to the code I use.
You will be able to have your functional GPT in a second.
There are certain configurations needed though.
Make sure you to run Flutter CLI to connect the frontend to a firebase project.
Make sure to use your own mongoose DB link as I have removed mine and so generation will not work.
So please do so.
Either than that, you are good to go.
As always, I am here to help. Please reach out and I will offer any assistance I can.
Happy GPT cloning.
